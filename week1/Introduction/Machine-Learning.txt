What is Machine Learning?


Machine Learning  uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes.
As the alogrithms ingest training data, it is then possible to produce more precise models based on that data. A Machine learning model is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with data. 
    
1. According to Aurthur Samuel- Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learning.
2. According to Tom Mitchell- Computer program is said to learn from experience "E" with respect to some task "T" and some performance measure "P".
    if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

    Example: playing checkers.

        E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
        T = the task of playing checkers.
        P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
        
Two Types of Machine Learning:

1) Supervised Learning.
    Teaching computers how to do certain task.
2) Unsupervised Learning.
    Let computer learn by itself to do any task.
