Supervised Learning- In the supervised learning, we are given a dataset and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

    Regression problem - Predict results within continuous valued output.
            Mapping input variables to some continuous function.
        ex- Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture.
    
    Classification problem - Predict results in a discrete output. Mapping input variables into discrete categories.
        ex- Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
