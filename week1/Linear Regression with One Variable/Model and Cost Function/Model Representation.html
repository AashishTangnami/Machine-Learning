Supervised Learning - Given the 'right answer' for each example in the data.
Regression Problem - Predict real-valued output.
<br>

If we are given  the quotes "right answer" then this is an regression problem( this means we are predicting a real-valued output).
Common type of supervised learning problems are also called the classification problem where we predict discrete-valued ouputs 
such as if we are looking at cancer tumors and trying to decide if a tumor is malignant or benign.
So that's zero and one (0,1) valued discrete output.
<br>

In supervised learning, we have a dataset and this data set is called a training set. 
<br>

commonly used:
Notations-
m = number of training examples
x's = "input" variable/ features.
y's = "output" variable/ "target" variable. 
<br>

a pair of (x's , y's) is called a training example,
x,y:i=1,...,m -> us training set.

i is the index into the training set.

X is denoted as space of input values,
Y is denoted the space of output values,

<br>
The supervised learning problem, our goal is,
we are given a training set;
to learn a function h:X->Y so that h(x) us a "good" predictor for the corresponding value of y.
this function h is called a hypothesis.

training set -> learning algorithm -> (x) -> h -> predicted(y)
<br>


When the target value we'are trying to predict is continuous, we call the learning problem a regression problem, 
When y can take on only a small number of discrete values
( such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment) 
we call it a classification problem.
