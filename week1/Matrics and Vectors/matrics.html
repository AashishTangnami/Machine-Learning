<h3>Matrices are two-dimensional arrays:
</h3>

[[a b c],[d, e ,f]] - this matrix has two rows and three columns.

A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows.

Thus vectors are a subset of matrices.

<h3>Addition and Scalar Multiplication:</h3>

Addition and subtraction are element-wise, so we can simply add or subtract each corresponding element:

<h3>Matrix-Vector Multiplication</h3>

We map the column of the vector onto each row of the matrix, multiplying each element and summing the result.

[a bc def f]*[xy] = [a*x + b * yc * x + d * ye * x + f * y]

The result is a vector.
The number of the matrix must equal the number of row of the vector.

An m * n matrix multiplied by an n * 1 vector results in an m * 1 vector.

<h4>>Matrix Multiplication Properties</h4>
Matrices are not commutative: A∗B \neq B∗AA∗B  =B∗A

Matrices are associative: (A∗B)∗C =  A∗(B∗C)(A∗B)∗C=A∗(B∗C)

The identity matrix, when multiplied by any matrix of the same dimensions, results in the original matrix. It's just like multiplying numbers by 1. The identity matrix simply has 1's on the diagonal (upper left to lower right diagonal) and 0's elsewhere.

When multiplying the identity matrix after some matrix (A∗I), the square identity matrix's dimension should match the other matrix's columns. When multiplying the identity matrix before some other matrix (I∗A), the square identity matrix's dimension should match the other matrix's rows.



<h4>Inverse and Transpose</h4>
The inverse of a matrix A is denoted A^{-1}A−1
 . Multiplying by the inverse results in the identity matrix.

A non square matrix does not have an inverse matrix. We can compute inverses of matrices in octave with the pinv(A)pinv(A) function and in Matlab with the inv(A)inv(A) function. Matrices that don't have an inverse are singular or degenerate.

The transposition of a matrix is like rotating the matrix 90° in clockwise direction and then reversing it.
